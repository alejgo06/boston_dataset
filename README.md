# Boston_dataset

## motivation

Boston is a very popultaed city where there are reviews. But how are these reviews? how many there are per year? are always the same number of reviews each month?

I have analyzed this dataset. I have tried to answer only a few questions such as:
- how many reviews there are per year? 
- there is a month that the number of reviews increase?
- what is the name of the more frequency reviewers?
-  what are the most positive articles with more than 5 reviews?

## Attached files:
